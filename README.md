## About Dataset  

### Context  
The stock market data can be fascinating to analyze, and strong predictive models can lead to significant financial gains. While vast amounts of financial data are available online, finding a large, well-structured dataset covering a wide array of companies can be challenging.  

In this dataset, historical stock prices for IBM over the last 12 years are provided, totaling 3,019 rows of data.  

### Dataset Overview  
The data is structured to meet various needs and computational limitations. It includes files containing historical stock data with the following columns:  

- **Date**: in the format yy-mm-dd  
- **Open**: price of the stock at market open (in USD)  
- **High**: highest price reached during the day  
- **Low**: lowest price reached during the day  
- **Close**: closing price of the stock  
- **Volume**: number of shares traded  
- **Name**: the stock's ticker in the financial market  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using various deep learning models: **LSTM, GRU, and RNN**. These models help analyze historical stock prices and forecast future trends with improved accuracy.
